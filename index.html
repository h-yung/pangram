                <p>
                    There are three main pieces approached with flaws, the biggest being performance: How do you narrow down on the many combinations possible with seven letters, where each letter appears at least once but the final word length is only known to be greater than or equal to seven?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Absent a sophisticated language processing approach for the time being, brute force leads to the following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Very rough logic: In English, the same letter is unlikely to be repeated consecutively three times. So we get the function <code>narrowDown(string) that returns a Boolean.</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A pangram for a given letter set can easily exceed seven-letter length, but in theory, a recognizable word can be spotted within the first seven letters. Currently, this requires a human/manual assessment. But until the thousands of combinations can be reduced, this approach has been deprioritized. Implications: Pangrams that exceed a seven-letter count are currently out of scope of this program, a major flaw.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The last step is currently throwing the resulting seven-lettered strings - ideally pared down with fragmentary guesses - at a dictionary. This is very unkind and poor use of an API, so that part is actually detached from the current filtering and string generation logic and requires a manual call from console. Also see previous point for caveat.

                </ol>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The New York Times releases a new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee">Spelling Bee</a> round every day (turn over is probably based on Eastern Time Zone). With the seven given letters, players must put together valid English words. A valid word that uses all seven letters &mdash; repeated letters allowed &mdash; will have found the "pangram". Sometimes there is more than one pangram for a given set of letters.</p>
            <h3>The challenge</h3>
            <p>Non-subscribers get very limited chances to guess the pangram &mdash; too many of the shorter words and you get locked out.</p>
            <p>Naturally, if you want to get the pangram, you will conserve your guesses or try to make ones that seem incrementally useful. Sometimes you will figure it out in the first instant when looking at the words. But that's not always the case.</p>
            <h3>The solution?</h3>
            <p>It is currently faster for an English-speaking human (sample size: 1) to find the pangram than the program as currently written, but the work is in progress.</p>
