                    </summary>
                    <p>The New York Times releases a new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee">Spelling Bee</a> round every day (turn over is probably based on Eastern Time Zone). With the seven given letters, players must put together valid English words. A valid word that uses all seven letters &mdash; repeated letters allowed &mdash; is considered a "pangram". Sometimes there is more than one pangram for a given set of letters.</p>
        
                    <h5>The challenge</h5>
                    <p>Non-subscribers get very limited chances to guess the pangram &mdash; too many of the shorter words and you get locked out.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, if you want to get the pangram, you will conserve your guesses or try to make ones that seem incrementally useful. Sometimes you will figure it out the moment you see the letters, but that's not always the case.</p>
                    <h5>A solution?</h5>
                    <p>It is currently faster for an English-speaking human (sample size: 1) to find the pangram than the program as currently written, so the work is in progress.</p>
